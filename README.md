# Graph Theory Project
## Introduction
My name is Colm Woodlock, student number : G00341460, and this is my attempt at the project for the graph theory module.
This project is worth 50% of the overall mark of the module. The project is written in Golang.

### Instructions to Downloading and Running this project
### Downloading
First to download the project you need to ensure you have both git and go installed on your machine. To do this follow the links below and you can download and install both.
https://golang.org/dl/
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once you have both downloaded you can now download the project itself. To do this simply open a command line and navigate to a directory you wish to download the file to. Once you are in this directory simply enter the following commands: 
git clone https://github.com/cwoodlock/GraphTheoryProject
Once this command completes you will now have it cloned into your selected directory.

### Running
Once you have downloaded everything you need you can now run the project. Again this is very simple. All you have to do is ensure you are in the directory which contains the project and enter the command: 
go run main.go
This will run the project and you will be prompted by the command line menu.
